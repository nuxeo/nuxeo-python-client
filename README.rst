Client Library for Nuxeo API
----------------------------

|Build Status| |Quality| |Coverage|

The Nuxeo Python Client is a Python client library for the Nuxeo
Automation and REST API. It works with Python 3.6+.

This is an ongoing project, supported by Nuxeo.

Getting Started
---------------

The installation is as simple as:

.. code:: shell

    python -m pip install -U --user nuxeo

The client can make use of the Amazon S3 provider, to install its requirements:

.. code:: shell

    python -m pip install -U --user "nuxeo[s3]"

The client is compatible with OAuth2 mechanism, to install its requirements:

.. code:: shell

    python -m pip install -U --user "nuxeo[oauth2]"

And to install several flavors of requirements:

.. code:: shell

    python -m pip install -U --user "nuxeo[oauth2, s3]"

Import
------

Then, use the following ``import`` statement to have access to the Nuxeo
API:

.. code:: python

    from nuxeo.client import Nuxeo

Documentation
-------------

Check out the `API documentation <https://nuxeo.github.io/nuxeo-python-client/latest/>`__.

Requirements
------------

The Nuxeo Python client works only with:

-  the Nuxeo Platform >= LTS 2015
-  ``requests`` >= 2.12.2 (for unicode authentication)
-  ``setuptools`` >= 30.3.0

Quick Start
-----------

This quick start guide will show how to do basics operations using the
client.

Connect to the Nuxeo Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to connect to the Nuxeo Platform with a basic authentication
is passing a tuple containing the ``username`` and the ``password`` to the
client, like so:

.. code:: python

    nuxeo = Nuxeo(auth=('Administrator', 'Administrator'))


You can then use the ``nuxeo`` object to interact with the Platform. If you want
to use a specific instance, you can specify the ``base_url`` like so:

.. code:: python

    nuxeo = Nuxeo(
        host='http://demo.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/',
        auth=('Administrator', 'Administrator')
    )

Download/Upload Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the `nuxeo/constants.py <nuxeo/constants.py>`__ file, you have several constants that are
used throughout the client that you can change to fit your needs. Some of them are:

-  ``CHECK_PARAMS`` (False by default), to check operation's parameters for each and every HTTP calls.
-  ``CHUNK_LIMIT`` (10 MiB by default), the size above which the upload will automatically be chunked.
-  ``CHUNK_SIZE`` (8 KiB by default), the size of the chunks when downloading.
-  ``MAX_RETRY`` (5 by default), the number of retries for connection error on any HTTP call.
-  ``UPLOAD_CHUNK_SIZE`` (20 MiB by default), the size of the chunks when uploading.


Run NXQL Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run queries in NXQL (NXQL is a subset of SQL,
you can check how to use it `in the documentation <https://doc.nuxeo.com/nxdoc/nxql/>`__).
Here, we are first `fetching a workspace <documents.rst>`__, and then using its
``uid`` to build a query which will find all its children that have a ``File``
or ``Picture`` type, and are not deleted.

.. code:: python

    # Fetch a workspace
    ws = nuxeo.documents.get(path='/default-domain/workspaces/ws')

    # Build a query using its UID
    nxql = ("SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:ancestorId = '{uid}'"
            "   AND ecm:primaryType IN ('File', 'Picture')"
            "   AND ecm:currentLifeCycleState != 'deleted'")
    query = nxql.format(uid=ws.uid)

    # Make the request
    search = nuxeo.client.query(query, params={'properties': '*'})

    # Get results
    entries = search['entries']

``entries`` will be a ``list`` containing a ``dict`` for each
element returned by the query.

Usage
~~~~~

Now that your client is set up, here are pages to help you with the
main functions available:

-  `Available authentication mechanisms <examples/authentication.rst>`__
-  `Manage users and groups <examples/users_and_groups.rst>`__
-  `Work with documents <examples/documents.rst>`__
-  `Work with directories <examples/directories.rst>`__
-  `Work with blobs <examples/blobs.rst>`__
-  `Work with comments <examples/comments.rst>`__
-  `Run requests <examples/requests.rst>`__
-  `Helpers <examples/helpers.rst>`__
-  `Useful snippets <examples/snippets.rst>`__
-  `Script: Find duplicates <examples/find_duplicates.py>`__
-  `Script: Create a live proxy <examples/create_proxy.py>`__

You can also check `the  API documentation <http://nuxeo.github.io/nuxeo-python-client/latest/>`__
of this Python client for further options.

Setup
~~~~~

.. code:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-python-client
    cd nuxeo-python-client
    python -m pip install -e ".[oauth2, s3]"

Test
~~~~

A Nuxeo Platform instance needs to be running on
``http://localhost:8080/nuxeo`` for the tests to be run, and then:

.. code:: shell

    python -m pip install -U --user tox
    tox

Sentry
======

We use Sentry to catch unhandled errors from tests.
You can tweak it before running ``tox``.

It can be disabled:

.. code:: shell

    export SKIP_SENTRY=1

You can also customize the Sentry DSN for your own team:

.. code:: shell

    export SENTRY_DSN="XXX"

And customize the Sentry environment too:

.. code:: shell

    # Note that the default value is "testing"
    export SENTRY_ENV="testing"

Deploying
~~~~~~~~~

Releases are fully automated, have a look at that `GitHub Action <https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-python-client/actions?query=workflow%3ARelease>`__.
