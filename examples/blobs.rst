Work with blobs
---------------

**Add a Blob to a file**

When uploading a blob, you can choose to do a chunked upload
by passing ``chunked=True`` to the upload method. If the file
is too big (``> constants.CHUNK_LIMIT``) it will be chunked
automatically even without this argument. An interrupted
chunked upload can be resumed by relaunching the upload
command with the same batch and blob.

.. code:: python

    from nuxeo.models import Document, FileBlob
    from nuxeo.exceptions import UploadError

    # Create a file
    new_file = Document(
        name='foo',
        type='File',
        properties={
            'dc:title': 'foo',
        })
    file = nuxeo.documents.create(new_file, parent_path='/')

    # Create and upload a blob
    blob = FileBlob('/path/to/file')
    try:
        uploaded = nuxeo.uploads.upload(blob, chunked=True)
    except UploadError:
        # The blob wasn't uploaded despite the 3 retries,
        # you can handle it however you like and relaunch
        # the same command

    # Attach it to the file
    operation = nuxeo.operations.new('Blob.AttachOnDocument')
    operation.params = {'document': '/foo'}
    operation.input_obj = uploaded
    operation.execute()
